Add a sidebarwidget with a fully css-customisable facebook fanbox to your WordPress-Blog.

**Features**

* Style it with your own CSS and make fit with your own blogdesign.
* Show the stream from your fanpage.

**Available Langauges**

* English

**Notes**

Thanks in advance to <a href="http://kkoepke.de/">Kai</a> for giving the idea for this plugin and also for testing it in his own <a href="http://kkoepke.de/blog/">blog</a> during the time of development.

**Important**

If you update to version 1.1.0 make sure to control your settings and save them. **This is needed to generate the new css-file.** 

== Installation ==

1. Unzip the ZIP plugin file
2. Copy the `facebook-fanbox-with-css-support` folder into your `wp-content/plugins/` directory
3. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

**Where do I find the ID of my fanpage?**

Just go to your facebook-fanpage and take a look at the link "edit page". The link looks like `facebook.com/pages/edit/?id=xxxxxxxxxxxxxxx`. The number with the 15 digits after `?id`= is what you need.
